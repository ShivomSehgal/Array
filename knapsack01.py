# Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. 
# In other words, given two integer arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1] which represent values and weights associated with n items respectively. 
# Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity, 
# find out the maximum value subset of val[] such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W. 
# You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).

# Input:
# N = 3
# W = 4
# values[] = {1,2,3}
# weight[] = {4,5,1}
# Output: 3
# Example 2:

# Input:
# N = 3
# W = 3
# values[] = {1,2,3}
# weight[] = {4,5,6}
# Output: 0
